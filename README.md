## Text Summarization app using streamlit & Transformers.

ðŸ¤— Transformers provides APIs to easily download and train state-of-the-art pretrained models. Using pretrained models can reduce your compute costs, carbon footprint, and save you time from training a model from scratch.

HuggingFace Transformer models provide an easy-to-use implementation of some of the best performing models in natural language processing. Transformer models are the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) in several NLP tasks such as text classification, text generation, text summarization, and question answering. 

I used BART or Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer model in this Text Summarization. HuggingFace provides access to both pre-trained and fine-tuned weights to thousands of Transformer models, BART being just one of them.

## How to use text summarizer ?
- first, clone this repo in your working directory. command - **git clone [repoURL]**
- install all the requirements by using **pip install -r requirements.txt** command.
- use **streamlit run main.py** command to run the app.
