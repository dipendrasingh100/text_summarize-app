## Text Summarization app using streamlit & Transformers.

🤗 Transformers provides APIs to easily download and train state-of-the-art pretrained models. Using pretrained models can reduce your compute costs, carbon footprint, and save you time from training a model from scratch. The models can be used across different modalities such as:

- 📝 Text: text classification, information extraction, question answering, summarization, translation, and text generation in over 100 languages.
- 🖼️ Images: image classification, object detection, and segmentation.
- 🗣️ Audio: speech recognition and audio classification.
- 🐙 Multimodal: table question answering, optical character recognition, information extraction from scanned documents, video classification, and visual question answering.

## How to use text summarizer ?
- first, clone this repo in your working directory. command **git clone [repoURL]**
- install all the requirements by using **pip install -r requirements.txt** command.
- use **streamlit run main.py** to run the app.
